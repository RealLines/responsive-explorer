This project was based on the window washing company that I created. I would use this website to allow my company to grow beyond just physical world items like posters and flyers.
This is a bootstrap website. These is nothing else really on here other then bootstrap.
At the moment I cant think of any real issues with the code. It works well and does what it is meant to do. So, I am pretty happy with the out come. Though I would want to fill it with more itmes later as it is a little dry on content.
